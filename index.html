                    <p>The Ranchu goldfish, nicknamed the "king of goldfish", is a stunning fish known for its egg-shaped body, deep belly, and lack of a dorsal fin.  They also have a unique head growth called a hood, which adds to their majestic appearance.  Despite their fancy looks, they are surprisingly hardy fish.</p>

    <p>Being a double-coated dog, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi sheds heavily all year around, with peaks in the spring and autumn. With regular brushing, their coat is fairly easy to maintain, as well as naturally water- and dirt repellent (at the exception of "fluffies")[clarification needed]. Intact females are also known to shed during heat.</p>
